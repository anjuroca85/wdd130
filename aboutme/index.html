    <p style="color:blue; font-size:150%; text-align:center; font-family: sans-serif;"> Hi everyone, My name is Andres Rojas, and I am from Bucaramanga, Colombia.<br>
        I served my mission in South Dakota from 2005-2007. My wife and I have two children.<br> 
        I work offshore in a boat doing seismic to study the seabed structure so that decisions<br> 
        can be made for oil and gas drilling or, as in my current project, to make decisions for <br>
        Carbon Capture Storage, which contributes to government efforts to have a cleaner environment.<br>
    </p>
    <p style="color:blue; font-size:150%; text-align:center; font-family: sans-serif;"> I did the technical support engineer after completing the Pathway Connect program,<br>
        certificate with Ensign College. My major is a bachelor's degree in Software development.<br>
        I enjoy Jiu-Jitsu. I love taking my bicycle into the mountains that surround my hometown.<br>
        I enjoy coding too!<br>
