            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p id="biography_p">Andres Julian Rojas Caballero is from Bucaramanga, Colombia, where he has lived most
                 of his life. He has traveled to several countries, visiting almost all the 
                 continents except Australia. Andres comes from a family of six siblings, being 
                 the youngest. He served a full-time mission in the South Dakota Rapid City Mission 
                 from 2005 to 2007. After his full-time mission, Andres graduated with a three-year 
                 associate degree in Electromechanics in March 2008. He is currently married with 
                 two beautiful children and loves to serve the Savior and even more observing his 
                 family serving the Redeemer. He works in an oil seismic company called Shearwater 
                 Geoservices. He does offshore surveys to analyze and study the seabed in search of 
                 hydrocarbons. Lately, he has also been involved in Carbon Capture Storage to 
                 contribute to the environment.
                He currently serves in the church as a young men priest quorum adviser. He was a 
                bishop in the Ca√±averal ward for almost two years.
                He knows success is preceded partly by having a great deal of enthusiasm and 
                aptitude for learning. Most importantly, keeping God's commandments.
                After completing the Pathway Connect program, he did the technical support engineer 
                certificate with Ensign College. His major is a bachelor's degree in Software 
                development.
                He enjoys Jiu-Jitsu. He loves taking his bicycle into the mountains that surround 
                his hometown.
