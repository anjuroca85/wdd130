        <b>Biography</b>
        Andres Julian Rojas Caballero is from Bucaramanga, Colombia, where he has lived most of his life. He has traveled to several countries, visiting almost all the continents except Australia. Andres comes from a family of six siblings, being the youngest. He served a full-time mission in the South Dakota Rapid City Mission from 2005 to 2007. After his full-time mission, Andres graduated with a three-year associate degree in Electromechanics in March 2008. He is currently married with two beautiful children and loves to serve the Savior and even more observing his family serving the Redeemer.

Lately, he has also been involved in Carbon Capture Storage to contribute to the environment.
        He currently serves in the church as a young men priest quorum adviser. He was a bishop in the Cañaveral ward for almost two years.
        He knows success is preceded partly by having a great deal of enthusiasm and aptitude for learning. Most importantly, keeping God's commandments.

      <h3>Work Experience</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Job profile</b>
        Avid for data analysis. I am passionate about establishing and following quality assurance and quality control measures. I have an associate title in Electromechanics. I have more than ten years of offshore O&G experience.
        Working offshore for over a decade has taught me how my ability can go beyond what I thought I could. Everyday challenges turned into best practices that, when accurately recorded, become wisdom for generations. Self-development and training are vital to improve individual performance and benefit the company. Some of my achievements during my current job are:
        • Exceeded USBL positioning client target specifications by 17% of the agreed job’s value
        • Generated on-board Python script for quality assurance checks in Node on a Rope operations
        • Executed data analysis through histograms to provide feedback to the crew, office team, and clients on the survey’s performance
        • Adapted to an acting-up role position and responded to new challenges imposed by the new title role, such as submitting reports on time and executing quality assurance and quality control tools
        • Produced a quality control tool to calculate the right source sequence to compensate for a software bug and avoid damaging the company’s reputation by acquiring data in the wrong place
        • Organized Efficiently data acquisition plans to enhance the company’s returns by exceeding customer’s tight targets and specifications by 5%

      </ul>
      <h3>Current Projects</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Studying goals</b>
        Apart from my offshore work activity, I am currently studying online. It is a bachelor's degree in Software Development from BYU-Idaho University in the USA (https://www.byui.edu/catalog/#/programs/ByUQAZhU9?searchTerm=software%20de&bc=true&bcCurrent=Software%20Development%20&bcItemType=programs).
        The time invested in studying has paid the benefits of troubleshooting issues offshore, understanding more about the software, communicating ideas about implementation in machine learning with the team, targeting client needs, feeding feedback in the Vessel Feedback Report about marketing team improvement in Shearwater website to capture more clients' attention in our technology, and creating basic scripts that increase efficiency in my daily tasks as a chief navigator in the NOAR operations.

        <b>Future Work assignments</b>
        I am undecided about moving to an onshore position because of the desire to experience a temporary office assignment in the Høvik office while maintaining my offshore status. This opportunity will allow me to see what it is like to work in the office and have the office team evaluate my performance there.
