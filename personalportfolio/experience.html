            <h2>Offshore Background</h2>
            <p>Avid for data analysis. I am passionate about establishing and following quality 
                assurance and quality control measures. I have an associate title in 
                Electromechanics. I have more than ten years of offshore O&G experience. 
                Working offshore for over a decade has taught me how my ability can go beyond 
                what I thought I could. Everyday challenges turned into best practices that, 
                when accurately recorded, become wisdom for generations. Self-development and 
                training are vital to improve individual performance and benefit the company.</p>
